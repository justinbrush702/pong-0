# pong.0
My first ever software project.

ORIGINALLY CREATED: 2012.12.10

I put this up on Github to share a very early project of mine, and I encourage people to make changes / improvements if they like.

How To Use Pong.0:
  Open the game by running PongTester.java (contains the main method). Read the instructions of the game in the window that opens up.

TODO: Write a script/Makefile that compiles project, cleans formatting, runs project, etc.
